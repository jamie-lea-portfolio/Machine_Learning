# Machine Learning
This repository shows selected work from my graduate machine learning class.
There are two projects:
1. A math and programming project for a simplified learning scenario (Problem 2.24 in Learning From Data A Short Course)
* A pdf of the project report
* The LaTeX files used to create the pdf.
* TODO: the python files used.
2. A proof of the convergence of the perceptron learning algorithm for non-normalized data.
* A pdf of the proof
* The LaTeX files used to create the pdf.
